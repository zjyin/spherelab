<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em; text-align:justify"> Who We Are </span> --->

> We are a research group in the Department of Biomedical Informatics ([DBMI](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/)) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, affiliated with the Health Information Privacy Laboratory ([HIPLab](https://hiplab.mc.vanderbilt.edu)), the Vanderbilt HEAlth Data Science Center ([HEADS](https://www.vumc.org/heads)), and the Center for Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings ([GetPreCise](https://www.vumc.org/getprecise/)). 

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em; text-align:justify"> Motivation </span> --->
> Our research is motivated by a large amount of data generated by people/machines in both online and offline environments. We believe that the data, or the evidence hidden in the data, is the key to understanding personal as well as public health and well-being. While new technologies have dramatically changed the world, the nature of social interaction and isolation of human beings is deemed to be a significant factor when decoding such evidence. 

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;  text-align: justify"> Aim </span> --->
> We aim to apply computational methods to the data that reside within/beyond electronic health records to tell stories that have strong implications for health-related behaviors, outcomes and policies. We will study the extent to which social/peer/professional support, as well as information system/technology, influences health and well-being in a long-term, dynamic, and collective manner.
