<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> Who We Are </span> --->
> We are a research group in Department of Biomedical Informatics ([DBMI](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/)) at Vanderbilt University Medical 
> Center. We are affiated with the Vanderbilt HEAlth Data Science Center ([HEADS](https://www.vumc.org/heads)), and the Center for 
> Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings ([GetPreCise](https://www.vumc.org/getprecise/)). 

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> Motivation </span> --->
> Our research is motivated by a large amount of data generated by people/machine in both online and offline environments. 
> We believe that the data, or the evidence hidden in the data, is the key to understanding personal as well as public health 
> and well-being. Yet, while new technologies have dramatically changed the world, the nature of social interaction and isolation of 
> human beings is deemed to be a significant factor when decoding such evidence. 

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> Aim </span> --->
> We aim to apply social computing, data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques 
> to analyzing, modeling and predicting health-related behaviors and outcomes through using the data that reside within/beyond 
> traditional electronic health records. We will study the extent to which social/peer/professional support, as well as information 
> system/device/technology, influences health and well-being in a long-term, dynamic, and collective fashion. 

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> Collaboration </span> --->
> We are collaborating researchers from computer science, biomedical informatics, biostatistics, medicine, genetics, and sociology to 
> solve the challenges in this exciting research area.
