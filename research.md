<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> [R37 CA237452-01A1](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9954467&icde=50991416&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) (NCI, Principal Investigator)</span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"><br>Title: Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records</span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"><br>Period: 05/01/2020 – 04/30/2024</span>
> R37 is the Method to Extend Research in Time ([MERIT](https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/grants-funding/funding-opportunities/merit)) 
>Award provides longer term grant support to Early Stage Investigators (ESIs). Only ESI R01 applications that receive a score within the 
> NCI payline for experienced and new investigators are eligible for consideration to be converted to an ESI MERIT Award if all PIs have ESI status at the time of award.

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> <br>Title: Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings – GetPreCiSe</span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"><br>Period: 05/16/2016 – 04/30/2021</span>
> Genomics research and the incorporation of its fruits into clinical care are impeded by concerns about privacy and identification. 
> These worries, which have multiple sources, are poorly understood, and legal and social efforts to address them are inadequate. 
> GetPreCise will use broadly interdisciplinary approaches to develop a more complete understanding of these concerns, which when used to 
> inform modeling will allow development of evidence-based methods to allay concerns, thereby facilitating the use of genomics to improve 
> health.

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> <br>Title: A Risk Management Framework for Identifiability in Genomics Research</span>
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"><br>Period: 09/21/2012 – 07/31/2021</span>
> The goals of this research project are to develop an interdisciplinary framework to a) model genomic data re-identification risks, b) 
> measure the risks given computational and socio-legal constraints, and c) assist in determining which data protection strategies are > 
> the most appropriate to specific data sharing scenarios.
