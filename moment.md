<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">... Research is merely a life that we choose, no magic and no difference from any other job in this society. If you really want me to pick something different, I would say we sacrifce leisure for something that we call freedom, a freedeom that we _believe_ to do whatever we want, but a biggest "lie" ever told :-). We alway try to not blend our life with work... research, however, as [Dr. Daniel Fabbri](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/person/daniel-fabbri-phd) once told me, is something that makes you feel that you are working on a Saturday but everyday looks like a Saturday ... We are always used to what we used to be, but forget who we are ... People come and go, and cherich every moment that we were once **together**, talking, eating, smiling, and doing something that we believe can contribute to the world, no matter how tiny it is ... </span>
