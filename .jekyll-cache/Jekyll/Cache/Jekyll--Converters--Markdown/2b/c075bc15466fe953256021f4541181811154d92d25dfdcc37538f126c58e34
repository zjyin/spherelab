<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">... Research is merely a life that we choose, no magic or difference from any other job in the society. If you really want me to pick something, I would say we "sacrifce" leisure for something that we call freedom, a freedom that we _think_ to do whatever we want, but unfortunately, is a biggest "lie" ever told :-)... Research, as [Dr. Daniel Fabbri](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/person/daniel-fabbri-phd) once said, is something that makes you feel like working on a Saturday, but everyday is a Saturday :-)... We are always used to what we used to be, but forget who we are ... Cherish every moment that we were once **together**, chatting, smiling, and doing something that we believe can change the world, no matter how tiny it is ... <br>... **Note**: we are NOT working on food science :-) ...</span>

<p><span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;"> Research is not easy but we can have <strong>fun</strong> in doing it well. <br /> Cherish every moment that we are <strong>together</strong>, chatting, smiling, and doing something that we believe can change the world (no matter how tiny or big it is).
<br /><strong>Note</strong>: We are NOT working on food science ジ </span></p>
