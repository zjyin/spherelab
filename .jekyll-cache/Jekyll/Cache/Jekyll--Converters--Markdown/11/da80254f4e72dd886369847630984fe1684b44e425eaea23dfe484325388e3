<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em; text-align:justify"> Who We Are </span> --->

<blockquote>
  <p>We are a research group in Department of Biomedical Informatics (<a href="https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/">DBMI</a>) at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center, affiated with the Health Information Privacy Laboratory (<a href="https://hiplab.mc.vanderbilt.edu">HIPLab</a>), the Vanderbilt HEAlth 
Data Science Center (<a href="https://www.vumc.org/heads">HEADS</a>), and the Center for 
Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (<a href="https://www.vumc.org/getprecise/">GetPreCise</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em; text-align:justify"> Motivation </span> --->
<blockquote>
  <p>Our research is motivated by a large amount of data generated by people/machines in both online and offline environments. 
We believe that the data, or the evidence hidden in the data, is the key to understanding personal as well as public health 
and well-being. While new technologies have dramatically changed the world, the nature of social interaction and isolation of 
human beings is deemed to be a significant factor when decoding such evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--- <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;  text-align: justify"> Aim </span> --->
<blockquote>
  <p>We aim to apply computational methods on the data that reside within/beyond electronic health records to tell stories that 
have strong implications for health-related behaviors, outcomes and policies. We will study the extent to which social/peer/
professional support, as well as information system/technology, influences health and well-being in a long-term, dynamic, and 
collective fashion.</p>
